# Profile Page_NixonBit
 
I have designed this simple UI for a Profile and Edit Details page using Flutter.

This app consists of a page where you enter your details save them.
Also, user can add a profile photo for their profile. This is implemented using the Image_picker Flutter package.

On saving, it will redirect the user to the profile page where the user will be able to see their details in an organised manner.

The user can also edit their username and bio on clicking the "Edit" button. Note that the user can only edit their username and bio.

This is just a simple UI for the profile page with primitive functionality.
It can be further upgraded for storing details with different profile photos of multiple users and providing different UI for them using Firebase.
